Program 4 - Hashing

	The 'poetry' generated by this program often is nonsense. This largely depends on what file is read in to
begin with. The computer does not know anything about the requirements for a complete sentence. Therefore there is
no punctuation nor breaks in the poem. This makes it very hard to read as it is one large runon sentance that does
not combine nouns with verbs. The reason the input file is so important is that some input files are much less 
elegant of speach and make it much easier on the program to correctly assign verbs to nouns. An example of such a 
poem is that of Green Eggs and Ham by Dr Suess. A much more extravagent poem such as Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe
is a bit wordier and therefore is much more difficult for the algorithm to achieve complete sentence structures.
If the algorithm could generate punctuation, use proper sentence structure, and correctly assign pronouns and adverbs
the generated poems would be much more coherant.
